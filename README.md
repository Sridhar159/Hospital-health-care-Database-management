# Healthcare Database Management System
## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive Healthcare Database Management System (DBMS) to address the complexities of the healthcare industry, including escalating costs, increasing demands for high-quality care, and an aging population.

## Features
### Transactional Database Backbone: 
Utilize a robust Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) database to ensure real-time data integrity for essential operations such as patient registrations and diagnosis recording.

### Analytical Power of OLAP:
Leverage the analytical capabilities of Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases to explore structured, transformed data for in-depth healthcare insights and analysis.

### ETL for Seamless Data Flow:
Implement an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure seamless and periodic updates to the OLAP database, facilitating a foundation for real-time analysis and reporting.

### Monthly Executive Report:
Access crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) through executive dashboards, enabling monitoring of Doctor-Patient interactions, Severity statistics, Disease prevalence, and more.

### Medication Availability Dashboard:
Explore real-time insights into medicine instock details through a PowerBI dashboard connected to the OLTP database, providing a snapshot of medication availability.

## Tools Used
PostgreSQL: Utilized for the relational database management system.
DB Schema: Employed for data modeling and database design.
PowerBI: Leveraged for creating interactive dashboards and reports.
Lucid Chart: Utilized for visualizing data models and system architecture.

## Skills Learned
Data Modeling: Understanding and designing efficient database schemas.
Server-Side Code: Implementing backend logic and business rules.
ETL Process: Extracting, transforming, and loading data for analysis.
NoSQL Structure in MongoDB: Exploring non-relational data storage and querying.
Snowflake Concepts: Understanding snowflake schema design for data warehousing.
